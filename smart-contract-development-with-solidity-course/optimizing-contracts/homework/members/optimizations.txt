1. Members should not be a seperate contract but a library as it would be expensive to create new contract for each new Members
2. modifier only member takes too much information to see of sender is a member - instead it could see if jointedAt is bigger than zero
3. tmp variable and memberList can simply be removed as they are not used anywhere and do not seem to hold valuable information for the contract
